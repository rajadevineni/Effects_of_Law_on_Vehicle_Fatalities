# Effects_of_Law_on_Vehicle_Fatalities

>This project was undertaken as academic study to understand and apply the concepts of **BUAN 6312-Applied Econometrics and Time Series Analysis for Business Analytics**. The data set chosen by the course instructor and the analysis done as part of this project is not representative of the overall statistics.

## Introduction:
Do laws like Tax on Case of Beer ($), Mandatory Jail Sentence, Mandatory Community Service,  Minimum Legal Drinking Age  affect Number of Vehicle Fatalities in the United States of America? Various hypothesis are tested and found some surprising results.


## Dataset: 
The Dataset consists of data on 48 states over 7 years, 1982-1988. This is panel data where State and Year are considered as indexes, however the regressions models are developed on Pooled, Fixed and Random methods. Multiple methods are developed in this project but only the final models (1-pooled & 1-fixed) are detailed below(verify the code for other models). 
The explanatory variables in models are choosen on general economic terms where we usually think there would be a relationship between the # vehicle fatalities and explanatory variables. 

The complete description of the dataset is available [**here**](https://github.com/rajadevineni/Effects_of_Law_on_Vehicle_Fatalities/blob/master/CarFatality_Dataset_Description.docx)
